<strong>Problem</strong> <strong>15.1:</strong> (4.2 #13. <em>Introduction</em> <em>to</em> <em>Linear</em> <em>Algebra:</em> Strang) Suppose <em>A</em> is the four by four identity matrix with its last column removed; <em>A</em> is four by three. Project <strong>b</strong> = (1, 2, 3, 4) onto the column space of <em>A</em>. What shape is the projection matrix <em>P</em> and what is <em>P</em>?

<strong>Problem</strong> <strong>15.2:</strong> (4.2 #17.) If <em>P</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>P</em>, show that (<em>I</em> − <em>P</em>)<sup>2</sup> = <em>I</em> − <em>P</em>. For the matrices <em>A</em> and <em>P</em> from the previous question, <em>P</em> projects onto the column space of <em>A</em> and <em>I</em> − <em>P</em> projects onto the .
